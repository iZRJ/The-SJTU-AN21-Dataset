## Introduction
To make the classifier applicable to the current anonymity network traffic analysis, we collected the traffic data generated by ten anonymity services in the latest version of the three most popular anonymity networks (i.e., Tor, I2P, JonDonym).

## SJTU-NSSL Anonymity Network Traffic Dataset (SJTU-AN21) Content
In the SJTU-AN21 dataset, Eepsites, IRC, Snark, and Video are the four main anonymity services in the I2P network, and BitTorrent, Chat, FTP, Streaming, and Browsing are the five main anonymity services in the Tor network. We give a detailed description of the different types of traffic generated:

|Anonymity Services|Network|Training Dataset|Test Dataset|
|--|--|--|--|
| **Eepsites** |I2P|1,825|1,197|
| **IRC** |I2P|3,009|484|
| **Snark** |I2P|7,284|1,784|
| **Video** |I2P|12,577|581|
| **JonDonym** |JonDonym|1,254|967|
| **Bittorrent** |Tor|198|76|
| **Chat** |Tor|624|150|
| **FTP** |Tor|364|184|
| **Streaming** |Tor|949|598|
| **Browsing** |Tor|1,130|958|

There are 29,214 flows in the training dataset and 6,979 flows in the test dataset. Note that these flows were generated using a lightweight traffic analyzer [Tranalyzer2](https://tranalyzer.com).
